## Welcome to Minesweeper

Like 'Hello World', pretty much everyone has written a Minesweeper game during their learning journey at one point or another, so here's mine.
I didn't want to build a Minesweeper game which just plays in the Terminal and I didn't want it to look like I spent about an hour bashing it together. I took my time and tried to write a program which I was actually happy with. 


#### Installation

As I am extremely new at Github, please forgive me if I get this section wrong, but everything I have seen indicates the need for an instalation section. 
If you wish to download my Minesweeper game, please ensure that the main.py file is in the same directory as the assets folder and everything should run just fine. If you try and run main.py from a different directory as the assets folder or from inside the assets folder, it will not work.


#### Libraries

I tried to keep it as simple as possible for libraries, so I only used:

- **Tkinter** to create the window and GUI.
- **Random** to randomly place the mines
- **Pillow** to import the self-made assets


#### Techniques used

As I'm still a learner I decided to include the techniques I used in the code just to give you an idea of where I'm currently at as of the date this README file is written.

- **Core code fundamentals** 
	such as for/while loops, concatenation, nested lists, iteration, f-strings, functions etc
- **Classes**
	class creation and usage of Instances
- **Generators**
	creation and iteration through a generator
- **GUI**
	construction of a clean Gui with multiple frames, changing frames and popup notifications
- **Notation**
	clear notation is extremely important in making the code easier to understand. I tried to make my notation understandable for beginners.
